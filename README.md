# Network Speed Test

This Python script uses the `speedtest-cli` library to test your internet connection speed. It provides results for download speed, upload speed, and ping time (latency).

## Features

- **Download Speed**: Measures the speed at which your network can receive data (in Mbps).
- **Upload Speed**: Measures the speed at which your network can send data (in Mbps).
- **Ping**: Measures the latency between your machine and the server (in milliseconds).

## Requirements

You need to have Python installed and the `speedtest-cli` module installed to run this script.

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/willin-broad/network-speed-test.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd network-speed-test
   ```

3. **Install the required Python package:**

   Install `speedtest-cli` using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install speedtest-cli
   ```

## How to Use

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python speed_test.py
```

This will output the download speed, upload speed, and ping in the terminal.

### Example Output

```bash
Download speed in mbps :: 50.23
Upload speed in mbps :: 12.45
Ping :: 34.5 ms
```
